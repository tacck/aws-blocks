### Patch Changes

- 1da34f1: fix(auth): propagate the structured error name through `setAuthState()`

  The recommended client auth path is `createApi()` → `setAuthState()`. When an
  action failed, `setAuthState()` caught the thrown `ApiError` and returned an
  `AuthState` carrying only `error: e.message`, discarding the structured
  `e.name` (e.g. `'InvalidCredentialsException'`). Because `AuthState` had no
  field for an error name, a hand-rolled client could not branch on error type
  (e.g. "try sign-in, fall back to sign-up for a brand-new user") without
  brittle string-matching the human-facing message.

  `AuthState` now carries an optional `errorName`, and the `bb-auth-basic` and
  `bb-auth-cognito` `setAuthState` implementations populate it from the thrown
  `ApiError.name` (skipping the generic `'ApiError'` default). A new
  `hasAuthError(state, name)` type guard in `@aws-blocks/core` lets clients
  branch on the returned state — `isBlocksError` only matches thrown `Error`
  instances, so it cannot be used on the plain `AuthState` object. Rule of
  thumb: throw path → `isBlocksError`; returned `AuthState` → `hasAuthError`.

## 0.1.2

### Patch Changes

- ba3bf7b: docs: add per-package DESIGN.md documents

  Adds a `DESIGN.md` to each building-block package describing its architecture, API surface, mock implementation, and key design decisions.

  - Each document is cross-checked against the current source so identifiers, environment variables, error names, and described behavior match the implementation.
  - Each `DESIGN.md` is listed in its package's `files` array so it ships on npm alongside `README.md`.
  - For consistency, `bb-auth-cognito`'s document lives at the package root like every other package.
  - Bumps the umbrella `@aws-blocks/blocks` package so its bundled `docs/` — assembled from these block READMEs at build time — republishes with a fresh version. Its packed content changes whenever the READMEs change, but the version was previously left untouched, which tripped the publish integrity guard.

- d4a1390: Fix `onAuthChange` and `Authenticator` to paint a synchronous first frame.

  Both previously deferred their initial emit/render behind the async
  `ensureState().then(...)`, so a signed-out UI never painted synchronously on
  subscribe — leaving a blank first frame and causing non-deterministic timeouts
  in CI harnesses (and contradicting `onAuthChange`'s documented "calls callback
  immediately" contract). `onAuthChange` now emits the last-known user from the
  shared cache synchronously, then refreshes from the async hydration — with a
  dedupe to avoid a spurious `null → user` flash and a `.catch` so a rejected
  `getAuthState()` never strands the UI. `Authenticator` does the same synchronous
  first paint from the cache and gains the same `.catch` hardening.
