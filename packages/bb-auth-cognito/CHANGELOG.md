## 0.1.6

### Patch Changes

- feb5be4: Add an opt-in `auth.admin` handle to `AuthCognito` for server-side group-membership and user-lifecycle administration.

  Enable it by passing an `admin` options object; `admin.actions` scopes both the granted `Admin*` / `List*` IAM **and** the compile-time method surface. Without it, `auth.admin` is a compile error and no admin IAM is granted (unchanged default).

  ```ts
  const auth = new AuthCognito(scope, "auth", {
    groups: ["admins"],
    admin: { actions: ["groups"] },
  });
  await auth.admin.addUserToGroup("alice", "admins");
  ```

  The admin surface is fully typed by the pool config `O`:

  - **Action gating:** calling a method whose action group wasn't granted (e.g. `deleteUser` under `actions: ['groups']`) is a compile error, and fast-fails at runtime with a clear message instead of a cryptic AWS `AccessDenied`.
  - **Typed reads:** `getUser` / `scan` / `listUsersInGroup` return `AdminUser<O>` — `groups` narrows to the configured group union and `attributes` keys to the declared attributes, matching the client-side `CognitoUser`.
  - **Typed writes:** `createUser`'s `attributes` narrow to the declared keys (catches typos like `signUp` does).
  - **`scan(filter?)`** accepts a server-side `AdminUserFilter` mapped to Cognito's `ListUsers` `Filter`.
  - **`setUserPassword(username, password, { permanent })`** takes a named options object instead of a bare boolean.

  The `AuthCognito` class generic is now a `const` type parameter, so inline options literals narrow without `as const`.

  Note: `const O` narrows the params of `requireRole`, `updateUserAttribute`, and `updateMFAPreference` for inline-literal options. Callers passing widened `string` variables to these may need a cast or literal arguments.

## 0.1.5

### Patch Changes

- 1da34f1: fix(auth): propagate the structured error name through `setAuthState()`

  The recommended client auth path is `createApi()` → `setAuthState()`. When an
  action failed, `setAuthState()` caught the thrown `ApiError` and returned an
  `AuthState` carrying only `error: e.message`, discarding the structured
  `e.name` (e.g. `'InvalidCredentialsException'`). Because `AuthState` had no
  field for an error name, a hand-rolled client could not branch on error type
  (e.g. "try sign-in, fall back to sign-up for a brand-new user") without
  brittle string-matching the human-facing message.

  `AuthState` now carries an optional `errorName`, and the `bb-auth-basic` and
  `bb-auth-cognito` `setAuthState` implementations populate it from the thrown
  `ApiError.name` (skipping the generic `'ApiError'` default). A new
  `hasAuthError(state, name)` type guard in `@aws-blocks/core` lets clients
  branch on the returned state — `isBlocksError` only matches thrown `Error`
  instances, so it cannot be used on the plain `AuthState` object. Rule of
  thumb: throw path → `isBlocksError`; returned `AuthState` → `hasAuthError`.

## 0.1.4

### Patch Changes

- ba3bf7b: docs: add per-package DESIGN.md documents

  Adds a `DESIGN.md` to each building-block package describing its architecture, API surface, mock implementation, and key design decisions.

  - Each document is cross-checked against the current source so identifiers, environment variables, error names, and described behavior match the implementation.
  - Each `DESIGN.md` is listed in its package's `files` array so it ships on npm alongside `README.md`.
  - For consistency, `bb-auth-cognito`'s document lives at the package root like every other package.
  - Bumps the umbrella `@aws-blocks/blocks` package so its bundled `docs/` — assembled from these block READMEs at build time — republishes with a fresh version. Its packed content changes whenever the READMEs change, but the version was previously left untouched, which tripped the publish integrity guard.

## 0.1.3

### Patch Changes

- 7fd51e0: fix(bb-auth-cognito): discriminate `SignInResult` on a string `status` field

  `SignInResult` (from `signIn` / `confirmSignIn` / `autoSignIn`) now discriminates
  on a string `status` (`'signedIn' | 'continueSignIn'`) instead of the `isSignedIn`
  boolean, so native-client codegen (Swift / Kotlin / Dart) emits clean, named,
  switch-decoded variants. Narrow with `if (result.status === 'signedIn')`.

  Breaking change to the `SignInResult` shape (pre-release): `isSignedIn` is removed,
  not aliased.
